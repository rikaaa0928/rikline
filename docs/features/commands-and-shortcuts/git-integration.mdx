Cline's Git integration brings AI assistance directly to your version control workflow. Generate commit messages without leaving your editor.

## Generate Commit Message

One of the most useful Git integrations is the ability to automatically generate meaningful commit messages:

1. Make your changes and stage them in Git
2. Click the robot icon in the Source Control view or run the "Generate Commit Message with Cline" command
3. Cline analyzes your changes and generates a descriptive commit message
4. The message is automatically inserted into the commit message input box

## Configuration

Before using the git integration features, you can configure the behavior to match your preferences:

### Git Settings

Access the git settings through:

-   **Command Palette**: `Cline: Configure Git Commit Settings`
-   **Source Control panel**: Click the settings gear icon next to git commands

Available settings:

-   **Auto AI Enhancement**: Automatically use AI to enhance commit messages without prompting
-   **Auto Accept High Confidence**: Automatically accept commit messages when confidence is above threshold
-   **Confidence Threshold**: Set the minimum confidence level (0-100%) for auto-accepting messages
-   **Show Analysis Details**: Display detailed analysis information in commit options
-   **Include Emojis**: Add emoji prefixes to commit types (e.g., ‚ú® feat:, üêõ fix:)
-   **Preferred Language**: Choose between English and Chinese for AI prompts

## Conventional Commits Support

Cline now supports **Conventional Commits** specification, helping you create standardized, semantic commit messages that follow industry best practices.

### Features:

-   **Automatic Type Detection**: AI analyzes your changes to suggest the appropriate commit type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
-   **Smart Scope Extraction**: Automatically detects and suggests scopes based on modified files
-   **Confidence Scoring**: Shows how confident the AI is about its analysis
-   **Manual Creation Wizard**: Step-by-step guide to create conventional commits manually
-   **Analysis Details**: View detailed reasoning behind AI suggestions

### Two Ways to Create Conventional Commits:

#### 1. AI-Enhanced Generation

Use the existing "Generate Commit Message with Cline" command, which now:

-   Analyzes your git diff using local pattern matching
-   Suggests commit type, scope, and message
-   Offers AI enhancement for better descriptions
-   Shows analysis confidence and reasoning

#### 2. Manual Creation Wizard

Use the new "Create Conventional Commit Message" command for:

-   Interactive step-by-step commit creation
-   Type selection with descriptions and emojis
-   Scope and description input with validation
-   Optional body and footer sections
-   Perfect for learning conventional commits

### Conventional Commit Types Supported:

-   **feat**: Êñ∞ÂäüËÉΩ (A new feature)
-   **fix**: ‰øÆÂ§ç (A bug fix)
-   **docs**: ÊñáÊ°£ (Documentation only changes)
-   **style**: Ê†ºÂºè (Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code)
-   **refactor**: ÈáçÊûÑ (A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature)
-   **perf**: ÊÄßËÉΩ (A code change that improves performance)
-   **test**: ÊµãËØï (Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests)
-   **build**: ÊûÑÂª∫ (Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies)
-   **ci**: CI (Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts)
-   **chore**: ÊùÇÈ°π (Other changes that don't modify src or test files)
-   **revert**: ÂõûÊªö (Reverts a previous commit)

### Example Conventional Commit Messages:

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
fix(api): resolve null pointer exception in user service
docs: update installation guide with new requirements
style: format code with prettier
refactor(parser): extract validation logic to separate module
perf(cache): implement lazy loading for heavy components
test(auth): add unit tests for login validation
build(deps): update React to version 18
ci: add automated testing to GitHub Actions
chore: update package.json version
```

The generated commit messages:

-   Follow the `<type>[optional scope]: <description>` format
-   Start with a concise summary (50-72 characters)
-   Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
-   Describe what was changed and why
-   Follow Git and Conventional Commits best practices

This feature saves time and ensures your commit history is consistent, semantic, and informative.

	Mentions](/features/at-mentions/git-mentions) documentation.

## How It Works

When you use Cline's commit message generation feature, here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. Cline retrieves the current Git diff using `getWorkingState()`
2. It analyzes the diff using pattern matching to determine commit type and scope
3. You can choose between using the AI-suggested message or enhancing it with AI
4. The AI analyzes the changes and generates an appropriate commit message
5. The message is extracted and presented with analysis details

This process uses your current Cline API configuration, so the quality of the generated messages matches your chosen AI model.

## Tips for Effective Use

-   **Configure for your workflow**: Enable "Auto AI Enhancement" for faster commits, or keep it disabled for more control over the process.

-   **Set appropriate confidence threshold**: If using auto-accept, set a threshold (e.g., 80%) that balances automation with quality control.

-   **Generate commit messages for complex changes**: The AI excels at summarizing multiple related changes into a coherent message.

-   **Review and edit generated messages**: While the AI generates high-quality messages, it's always good practice to review and adjust them if needed.

-   **Stage related changes together**: For the best results, stage related changes together so the AI can generate a cohesive message.

-   **Use for consistent commit history**: Using the generate commit message feature helps maintain a consistent style across your commit history.

-   **Learn conventional commits**: Use the manual wizard to learn conventional commits patterns and improve your commit message skills.

-   **Leverage automation for routine commits**: For simple changes like documentation updates or formatting fixes, auto-accept can save significant time.

## How It Works Under the Hood

The commit message generation leverages VSCode's Git extension API to access repository information:

1. When you trigger the command:
    - Cline gets the current diff
    - It analyzes file patterns, content changes, and code structure
    - For AI enhancement, it sends this to the AI with specific instructions for commit message formatting
    - It parses the AI's response
    - It accesses the Git extension API to set the commit message

This integration with Git makes it easy to generate high-quality commit messages without disrupting your workflow.

Next time you're struggling to write a good commit message, try using Cline's commit message generation. You'll save time and improve your version control workflow with AI assistance right where you need it.
